## Study Space
A quick and easy tool designed for college students to find a study space on campus by calculating the population in each room via laser gate sensors. The app itself contains a map of the college campus, a list of all available buildings and room on campus, and an alert system to notify the user when a room they've requested has reached a certain occupancy.

## Reflection
What was the context for this project? (ie: was this a side project? was this for Turing? was this for an experiment?)
What did you set out to build?
Why was this project challenging and therefore a really good learning experience?
What were some unexpected obstacles?
What tools did you use to implement this project?
This might seem obvious because you are IN this codebase, but to all other humans now is the time to talk about why you chose webpack instead of create react app, or D3, or vanilla JS instead of a framework etc. Brag about your choices and justify them here.
