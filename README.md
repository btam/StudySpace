# Study Space

This is an individual fork of a group project from HackDuke 2018. StudySpace is a quick and easy tool designed for college students to find a study space on campus by calculating the population in each room via laser gate sensors. 
The app itself contains a map of the college campus, a list of all available buildings and room on campus, and an alert system to notify the user when a room they've requested has reached a certain occupancy.

## Reflection

  - This app will enable students to spend less time wandering the library or other buildings looking for seats, and more time studying or working on assignments.
  - Although we used laser gates to calculate the population in each room, we recognize that it’s not a perfect solution and other alternatives exist, such as utilizing IR sensors or an Xbox Kinect to count how many bodies are in the room
  - Another possibility is to attempt to find out how many users are connected to the wifi in an area or building to approximate the number of occupants, which would entirely remove the need for hardware. This was the original idea, but it was more difficult to accomplish in the short period of time that we were working with in a hackathon.
  - In addition, more features can be added to the app, such as noise level, wifi quality, and outlet coverage. In order to encourage users to allow their microphones to be used for the noise level feature, the app might require that users give microphone permission to have access to noise level information. The app might not ask for such permissions at the outset; it might only ask for permission if the user requests noise information.
