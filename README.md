# Study Space

A quick and easy tool designed for college students to find a study space on campus by calculating the population in each room via laser gate sensors. 
The app itself contains a map of the college campus, a list of all available buildings and room on campus, and an alert system to notify the user when a room they've requested has reached a certain occupancy.

## Reflection

  - This app will help student’s save spend less time wandering the library looking for seats, and more time studying for the midterm or final that they’re worried about. 
  - Although we used laser gates to calculate the population in each room, we recognize that it’s not a perfect solution and other alternatives exist, such as utilizing IR sensors or an Xbox Kinect to count how many bodies are in the room
  - In addition, more features can be added to the app, such as noise level, wifi quality, and outlet coverage.
